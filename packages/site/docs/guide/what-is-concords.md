# What is Concords?

Concords is a Javascript data framework for building offline & decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.

The full demo app is available to try at [open.concords.app](https://open.concords.app)
